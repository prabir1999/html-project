                    <h3>The district was formed in 1999 when it was split from Lower Subansiri district.
                        The district is divided into three subdivisions: Itanagar capital complex, Yupia, and Sagalee.
                        The district is further divided into 15 administrative circles, namely, Balijan, Itanagar, Naharlagun,
                        Doimukh, Toru, Sagalee, Leporiang, Mengio, Kimin, Banderdewa, Tarasso, Kakoi, Gumto, Parang, and Sangdupota.
                        There are 3 Arunachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly constituencies located in this district: Itanagar, Doimukh
                        and Sagalee. All of these are part of Arunachal West Lok Sabha constituency.Itanagar capital complex is
                        administered by its own Deputy Commissioner, and contains the three circles of Itanagar, Naharlagun, and
                        Banderdewa. In January 2013 the Arunachal Pradesh government approved in principle the creation of a 
                        "Capital district". The capital complex is currently treated as its own district by some government departments,
                        the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises for example,[7] and the Arunachal Pradesh State portal in 
                        particular.
