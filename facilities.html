The state capital Itanagar was added to the Indian railway map on 12 April 2014 via the newly built 20 kilometre Harmuti-Naharlagun railway line, when a train from Dekargaon in Assam reached Naharlagun railway station, 10 kilometres from the centre of Itanagar, a total distance of 181 kilometres.</h2>

                <br>
                <h2>In Arunachal Pradesh, the population density here is very less. Because of which healthcare delivery cost is very high. There is no any private medical college till now. Arunachal Pradesh is lacking super specialties. Also, state is facing shortage of doctors such as neurosurgeon, cardiologist. The state is still very far behind the Indian healthcare scenario.</h2>
